Administrative management UI

## Get Started

To start the development environment, just run:

```
$ npm start
```

The application will start a webserver in 'watch' mode, refreshing always a code is changed. The webserver will listen the following local address: http://localhost:3000. 

**NOTE:** Please, do not use the development webserver in production.  If you need the app ready for production, just run:

```
$ npm run build
```
